## diffShit

`python3 runner_diff.py` to start simulation. If Boss You could make collision constrain outside taichi kernel scope, the total pipeline could be diff, though the gradient could be wrong. 

The distance constrain is differentiable now, so we could add some vibration when the cloth falling down.
